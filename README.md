# Social Feed App

Welcome to the Social Feed App - Meetmax! This application is designed to allow users to share posts, comment, like, and interact with friends and communities. Built using Flutter, clean architecture, and Riverpod for state management.

## Overview
The Social Feed Application is designed to demonstrate a clean and modular architecture for a social media feed. This application showcases how to effectively manage state, handle data flow, and maintain a responsive UI while distinguishing between UI and business logic.

## Key Features

- **Mocking the REST API Integration**: The application utilizes mocked APIs to simulate data retrieval, allowing for seamless development and testing without relying on a live backend.

- **Dependency Injection (Using get_it)**: Using dependency injection, the application is structured to be modular and maintainable, making it easier to test and update components independently.

- **Clean Architecture**: The application follows clean architecture principles, ensuring a clear separation of concerns and enhancing code maintainability.

- **State Management System**: The app uses Riverpod for state management, providing a robust way to manage the application's state and UI updates efficiently.

- **Distinction Between UI and Business Logic**: The architecture clearly separates UI components from business logic, improving code organization and readability.

- **Responsiveness of UI**: The application is designed to be responsive, ensuring a smooth user experience across different screen sizes and orientations.

- **API Mocking and JSON Handling**: The app employs Dio for HTTP requests, along with interceptors and an API client for handling JSON data efficiently.

- **Modular and Easy to Integrate with Backend**: The architecture is designed to facilitate easy integration with a backend service, allowing for straightforward enhancements and updates.
